You are given a closed interval ` [a, b] `. Your task is to compute the sum of digits of all odd numbers in this interval.

#### Example

For ` a = 5 ` and ` b = 12 , the output should be 
` SumOfDigits(a, b) = 23 `.

The odd numbers in the interval ` [5, 12] ` are  `5`, `7`, `9`, `11` and the sum is ` 5 + 7 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 23 `.

##### - [input] integer a

`1 ≤ a ≤ 109`

##### - [input] integer b

`1 ≤ b ≤ 109`

##### - [output] string

The sum of digits of all odd numbers in the given interval. It is guaranteed that this sum is less than `251`.
